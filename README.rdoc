=FlagShihTzu

A rails plugin to store a collection of boolean attributes in a single
ActiveRecord column as a bit field.

http://github.com/xing/flag_shih_tzu

This plugin lets you use a single integer column in an ActiveRecord model
to store a collection of boolean attributes (flags). Each flag can be used
almost in the same way you would use any boolean attribute on an
ActiveRecord object.

The benefits:
* No migrations needed for new boolean attributes. This helps a lot
  if you have very large db-tables where you want to avoid ALTER TABLE whenever
  possible.
* Only the one integer column needs to be indexed.

Using FlagShihTzu, you can add new boolean attributes whenever you want,
without needing any migration. Just add a new flag to the +has_flags+ call.

And just in case you are wondering what "Shih Tzu" means:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shih_Tzu


==Prerequisites

FlagShihTzu assumes that your ActiveRecord model already has an integer field
to store the flags, which should be defined to not allow NULL values and
should have a default value of 0 (which means all flags are initially set to
false).

The plugin has been tested with Rails versions from 2.1 to 2.3 and MySQL,
PostgreSQL and SQLite3 databases.


==Installation

  cd path/to/your/rails-project
  ./script/plugin install git://github.com/xing/flag_shih_tzu.git


==Usage

===Defining the flags

  class Spaceship < ActiveRecord::Base
    include FlagShihTzu

    has_flags 1 => :warpdrive,
              2 => :shields,
              3 => :electrolytes
  end

+has_flags+ takes a hash. The keys must be positive integers and represent
the position of the bit being used to enable or disable the flag.
<b>The keys must not be changed once in use, or you will get wrong results.</b>
That is why the plugin forces you to set them explicitly.
The values are symbols for the flags being created.


===Using a custom column name

The default column name to store the flags is 'flags', but you can provide a
custom column name using the <tt>:column</tt> option. This allows you to use
different columns for separate flags:

  has_flags 1 => :warpdrive,
            2 => :shields,
            3 => :electrolytes,
            :column => 'features'

  has_flags 1 => :spock, 
            2 => :scott,
            3 => :kirk,
            :column => 'crew'


===Generated instance methods

Calling +has_flags+ as shown above creates the following instance methods
on Spaceship:

  Spaceship#warpdrive
  Spaceship#warpdrive?
  Spaceship#warpdrive=
  Spaceship#shields
  Spaceship#shields?
  Spaceship#shields=
  Spaceship#electrolytes
  Spaceship#electrolytes?
  Spaceship#electrolytes=


===Generated named scopes

The following named scopes become available:

  Spaceship.warpdrive         # :conditions => "(spaceships.flags in (1,3,5,7))"
  Spaceship.not_warpdrive     # :conditions => "(spaceships.flags not in (1,3,5,7))"
  Spaceship.shields           # :conditions => "(spaceships.flags in (2,3,6,7))"
  Spaceship.not_shields       # :conditions => "(spaceships.flags not in (2,3,6,7))"
  Spaceship.electrolytes      # :conditions => "(spaceships.flags in (4,5,6,7))"
  Spaceship.not_electrolytes  # :conditions => "(spaceships.flags not in (4,5,6,7))"

If you do not want the named scopes to be defined, set the
<tt>:named_scopes</tt> option to false when calling +has_flags+:

  has_flags 1 => :warpdrive, 2 => :shields, 3 => :electrolytes, :named_scopes => false

In a Rails 3 application, FlagShihTzu will use <tt>scope</tt> internally to generate
the scopes. The option on has_flags is still named <tt>:named_scopes</tt> however.


===Examples for using the generated methods

  enterprise = Spaceship.new
  enterprise.warpdrive = true
  enterprise.shields = true
  enterprise.electrolytes = false
  enterprise.save

  if enterprise.shields?
    ...
  end

  Spaceship.warpdrive.find(:all)
  Spaceship.not_electrolytes.count
  ...


===How it stores the values

As said, FlagShihTzu uses a single integer column to store the values for all
the defined flags as a bit field.

The bit position of a flag corresponds to the given key.

This way, we can use bit operators on the stored integer value to set, unset
and check individual flags.

                +---+---+---+                +---+---+---+
                |   |   |   |                |   |   |   |
  Bit position  | 3 | 2 | 1 |                | 3 | 2 | 1 |
  (flag key)    |   |   |   |                |   |   |   |
                +---+---+---+                +---+---+---+
                |   |   |   |                |   |   |   |
  Bit value     | 4 | 2 | 1 |                | 4 | 2 | 1 |
                |   |   |   |                |   |   |   |
                +---+---+---+                +---+---+---+
                | e | s | w |                | e | s | w |
                | l | h | a |                | l | h | a |
                | e | i | r |                | e | i | r |
                | c | e | p |                | c | e | p |
                | t | l | d |                | t | l | d |
                | r | d | r |                | r | d | r |
                | o | s | i |                | o | s | i |
                | l |   | v |                | l |   | v |
                | y |   | e |                | y |   | e |
                | t |   |   |                | t |   |   |
                | e |   |   |                | e |   |   |
                | s |   |   |                | s |   |   |
                +---+---+---+                +---+---+---+
                | 1 | 1 | 0 | = 4 + 2 = 6    | 1 | 0 | 1 | = 4 + 1 = 5
                +---+---+---+                +---+---+---+

===Support for manually building conditions

The following class methods may support you when manually building
ActiveRecord conditions:

  Spaceship.warpdrive_condition         # "(spaceships.flags in (1,3,5,7))"
  Spaceship.not_warpdrive_condition     # "(spaceships.flags not in (1,3,5,7))"
  Spaceship.shields_condition           # "(spaceships.flags in (2,3,6,7))"
  Spaceship.not_shields_condition       # "(spaceships.flags not in (2,3,6,7))"
  Spaceship.electrolytes_condition      # "(spaceships.flags in (4,5,6,7))"
  Spaceship.not_electrolytes_condition  # "(spaceships.flags not in (4,5,6,7))"
  
These methods also accept a :table_alias option that can be used when 
generating SQL that references the same table more than once:

  Spaceship.shields_condition(:table_alias => 'evil_spaceships') # "(evil_spaceships.flags in (2,3,6,7))"


===Choosing a query mode

While the default way of building the SQL conditions uses an IN() list
(as shown above), this approach will not work well for a high number of flags,
as the value list for IN() grows.

For MySQL, depending on your MySQL settings, this can even hit the
'max_allowed_packet' limit with the generated query.

In this case, consider changing the flag query mode to <tt>:bit_operator</tt>
instead of <tt>:in_list</tt>, like so:

  has_flags 1 => :warpdrive, 
            2 => :shields, 
            :flag_query_mode => :bit_operator

This will modify the generated condition and named_scope methods to use bit
operators in the SQL instead of an IN() list:

  Spaceship.warpdrive_condition         # "(spaceships.flags & 1 = 1)",
  Spaceship.not_warpdrive_condition     # "(spaceships.flags & 1 = 0)",
  Spaceship.shields_condition           # "(spaceships.flags & 2 = 2)",
  Spaceship.not_shields_condition       # "(spaceships.flags & 2 = 0)",

  Spaceship.warpdrive         # :conditions => "(spaceships.flags & 1 = 1)"
  Spaceship.not_warpdrive     # :conditions => "(spaceships.flags & 1 = 0)"
  Spaceship.shields           # :conditions => "(spaceships.flags & 2 = 2)"
  Spaceship.not_shields       # :conditions => "(spaceships.flags & 2 = 0)"

The drawback is that due to the bit operator, this query can not use an index
on the flags column.


==Running the plugin tests

1. Modify <tt>test/database.yml</tt> to fit your test environment.
2. If needed, create the test database you configured in <tt>test/database.yml</tt>.

Then you can run

  DB=mysql|postgres|sqlite3 rake test:plugins PLUGIN=flag_shih_tzu

from your Rails project root or

  DB=mysql|postgres|sqlite3 rake

from <tt>vendor/plugins/flag_shih_tzu</tt>.
